P19V1_F5.csv az1, az2 (probably needs truncation)
P19V2_F5.csv az1, ay2, az2, maybe gx2, gy2
P20V1_20.csv maybe ay1, az1, ax2, gz2
P20V1_F5, a lot of them
P20V1_L5, ay1, az1, maybe gx2
P20V2_F5, ax1, ay1, az1, gy1, gx2, gz2

I feel like generating clean data might be a good idea. Just letting it sit for awhile, maybe letting it sit on a breathing person for awhile.

I guess I have the means to do that.
