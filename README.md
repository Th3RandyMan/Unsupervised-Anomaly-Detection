# Unsupervised-Anomaly-Detection
Project for detecting anomalies without ground truth.

### To do:
* Elbo Loss function (implemented, but check eval)
* Figure out training with different time series
    * Sequence?
    * Reset memory/state ?
* Change random split to just split end of data
    * Or no split
* Create evaluation methods
* Look into multichannel
